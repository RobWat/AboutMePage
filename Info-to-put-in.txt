About Me:

Age: 17
Born: November 29th in North Carolina, US


I grew up with an interest in computers and coding, with my father working
as a software developer. I am currently exploring a new passion of mine
in the Fine Arts field, while also currently learning programming and
design techniques. I am unsure which I will 
really pursue, or how I can combine them together, but I am getting there. 

Hobbies: 
- Making people laugh
- Reading science fiction Literature
- Drawing fantasy creatures

Goals: 
- Become an Animator or a Game Designer, 
- Create improvement among a community
- Write a book
- Find love

I am currently a part of FIND (FutureInDesign), a program dedicated to
helping young adults learn programming and design principles, as well as
personal business strategies and professionalism.
